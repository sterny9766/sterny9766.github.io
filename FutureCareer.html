 <p> The career I would like to have when i grow up is to be a surgeon. the qualifications required are the following:
First, complete an undergraduate degree program, usually in a science area such as biology or chemistry.Following undergraduate school.
Second, must complete four years of medical school and a three-year residency. I expect the location of the job to be in Israel, because
I am from there and going back there in a couple of years. The expected salary from this job is around 200,000 dollars a year, but it might
be more or less than that. Also if I would be good at the job, I might be a private Surgeon and then the salary will be greater than that.
To get the career I want to finish high school with good grades especially in Biology and chemestry. Then i wll follow the requirements 
fo the job and get all the education needed. After that I will work as a surgeon in a hospital for many years, and maybe be a private 
surgeon later in life.</p>
