<h1 style="text-align:center;font-size:250%;color:#001482;"> Sushi recipe </h1>
<h2 style="font-size:200%;"> Ingredients </h2>

<h3> For the rice</h3>
<p>1. one cup of white rice (sushi rice recommended)<br>
2. two cups of water<br>
3. three tablespoons of rice wine vinegar<br>
4. two tablespoons of sugar<br>
5. 1/2 tablespoon of salt </p> <br>

<h3> Everything else </h3>
<p>1. Makisu (bamboo rolling mat)<br>
2. Dark green Nori (dried seaweed)<br>
4. at least three of the optional ingredients below: <br>
5. Toasted seasame seeds (optional)<br>
6. imitation crab (optional)<br>
7. any veggies(cucumber, avocado, carrot, red pepper)<br>
9. cream cheese (optional) <br>
10. sliced salmon or tuna fish.( can be used fresh, smoked or in any way)</p> <br>

<h2 style="font-size:200%;"> Instructions </h2>
<p>1. Start by preparing your rice. Rinse rice in a fine mesh strainer until your water runs clear. Then add to a medium saucepan with
 water and bring to a boil. Once it boils reduce heat to low, cover and cook until water is completely absorbed – about 15 minutes.<br><br> 
2. In the meantime, add vinegar, sugar and salt to a small saucepan and heat over medium heat stirring occasionally until sugar 
and salt are dissolved. Place in a jar or dish and cool in the fridge until rice is ready.<br><br>
3. Once the rice is done, kill the heat and add the cooled vinegar mixture and stir with a rubber spatula or fork as to not overmix. 
It will appear wet but will dry up as you lightly stir to release heat. It should be sticky and completely dry once it’s ready.<br><br>
4. In the meantime, prep your veggies by chopping them into thin pieces. If they’re too bulky they won’t allow the sushi to roll well.<br><br>
5. in order to keep your rice from sticking to the Makisu and making a terrible mess, carefully wrap the Makisu in plastic cling wrap.<br><br>
6. To begin, fold the pieces of nori in half to split them. Nori is very delicate, so as soon as you press along the seam, it easily breaks
 in two.<br> <br>
7. Next, lay the half-sheets of nori on the work surface and grab a handful (about a ½ cup) of sushi rice and cover one side of a 
half-sheet of nori with it. To do so, first set the rice on the end of the nori sheet closest to you.
Then, working with your fingertips and/or knuckles, gently spread the rice over the surface of the nori.<br><br>
8. If you want the rice on the outside, quickly flip the rice-coated sheet of nori so that the rice side is down. Carefully position it  
horizontally so it will roll lengthwise. IF you want the seaweed on the outside just leave it as it is and place it on the mat. <br><br>
9.Next, place all  the optional ingredients you have. place a single row of the crab across the middle of the nori. Next, place slices
of avocado end to end right against the crab. Next, lay the  thin  cucumber, slices end-to-end right alongside the crab and avocado.
Place sliced fish along all those. Lastly place the cream cheese any way you like.<br><br>
10. To roll the sushi, carefully lift the edge of the mat closest to you, begin rolling the mat away from you, pressing it lightly to 
keep it firm. At this point, the end of the roll has been rolled upward, and your very light pressure is ensuring that they roll will 
remain nice and tight. <br><br>
11. Next, lift up the end of the rolling mat and pull it away from you, allowing the roll to roll the rest of the mat. Then carefully 
remove the roll from the mat and place it on a cutting board. Lay the mat over the top of the roll and exert gentle pressure once more 
to make sure it’s all secure. <br><br>
12.Next, hold the roll on the mat and sprinkle the top with toasted sesame seeds. Slice using a very sharp knife, first running the 
knife through a damp dishtowel with the blade facing away from you. Begin by slicing the roll exactly in half. Then set the two halves
side-by-side to slice into individual pieces. This ensures that each piece will be a uniform size.</p> <br>
