<p> <ins> Sushi</ins>- a japaneese food that contains some vagetables, fish, cheese and other ingredients wrapped in seaweed and Sushi 
rice. There are different types of sushi and different rolls that each contain different ingredients. click on the sushi image 
 to find recipes and tutorials of how to make sushi.</p>
 
<p> <ins> Pizza</ins>- this is also one of my favorite foods. Pizza is originally from italy but it isknown all around the world and is a
common food. pizza can be ordered with many different things on top like olives, extra cheese, pepperoni and more. My favorite is only 
cheese.</p>
 
<p><ins> Shawarma</ins> - Shawarma was invented in Turkey and is found mostly in the middle east. It is a Levantine meat preparation,
where lamb, chicken, turkey, beef, veal, or mixed meats are placed on a spit, and may be grilled for as long as a day.
 I really like this meat and it is one of my favorite foods. </p>
