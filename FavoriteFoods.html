<p><ins> Shawarma</ins> - Shawarma was invented in Turkey and is found mostly in the middle east. It is a Levantine meat preparation,
where lamb, chicken, turkey, beef, veal, or mixed meats are placed on a spit, and may be grilled for as long as a day.I really like this
 meat and it is one of my favorite foods. This food is usually not made at home because it requires large equipment most people don't own,
  but click on the Shawarma picture if you want to find how to make it.</p>
