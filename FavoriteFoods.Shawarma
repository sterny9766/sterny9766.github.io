<h1 style="text-align:center;font-size:250%;color:#001482;"> Chicken Shawarma recipe </h1>
<h2 style="font-size:200%;"> Ingredients </h2>


<p>1. 1 lb boneless skinless chicken breasts (2 large breasts)<br>
2. 1 lb boneless skinless chicken thighs (4 large thighs)<br>
3. 6 tbsp extra virgin olive oil divided<br>
4. 2 tsp cumin<br>
5. 2 tsp paprika <br>
6. 1 tsp allspice<br>
7. 3/4 tsp turmeric<br>
8. 1/4 tsp garlic powder<br>
9. 1/4 tsp cinnamon<br>
10. 1 pinch cayenne<br>
11. Salt and black pepper<br>
12. Nonstick cooking oil spray<br>

<h2 style="font-size:200%;"> Instructions </h2>

<p>1. Slice the chicken breasts into 5-6 pieces each and the thighs into 3-4 pieces each. Place them in a marinating dish or large 
plastic zipper bag.<br><br> 
2. In a small bowl, whisk together 1/4 cup olive oil, the spices, 3/4 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp black pepper (if you are salt sensitive, 
use 1/2 tsp of salt). Pour the spice marinade over the chicken pieces. Stir with a spoon till all the chicken pieces are evenly coated
in the marinade.<br><br>
3. Cover the marinating dish with plastic wrap, or close the zipper bag. Place chicken in the refrigerator and let it marinate at least
1 hour, up to overnight.<br><br>
4. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Spray the baking sheet with nonstick cooking oil. Place the chicken pieces on the sheet,
evenly spaced.<br><br>
5. Place the chicken in the oven. Let it roast for about 15 minutes until cooked through, turning the chicken pieces once with tongs
halfway through cooking.<br><br>
6. Take chicken out of the oven and let it cool slightly. Use a sharp knife to slice the meat into small, 
thin shawarma-like pieces.<br> <br>
7. Heat 1 tbsp of oil in a skillet on the stovetop over medium. Pour half of the chicken into the skillet and saute for 3-4 minutes
till the smallest pieces of chicken turn brown and crisp. Season with additional salt and pepper to taste, if desired.<br><br>
8.Remove the cooked chicken from the skillet. Heat another 1 tbsp of oil and saute the remaining chicken in 
the same way. Serve warm.</p> <br>
