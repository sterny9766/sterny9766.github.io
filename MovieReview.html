  <h2 style="color:#027002"> Spider-man Homecoming </h2>
  <p> The spider-man Homecoming movie is about a boy named Peter who was in a lab and was bitten by a lab spider in the previous movie. In this movie 
    he was with the avengers and then returned home. Peter wanted to fight crimes and prove himself while living ordinary lives. Everything
    changes when a new villain found a great power source and threatens everyone.</p>

 <br> I choose the movie, Spider-man Homecoming. I think it is a great action/adventure movie, and out of the new movies this is the one i 
    liked the most. I think it is interesting that the main character is a kid although he is the superhero and he is only 15.
  I think the movie is very entertaining and the actors did a great job.
